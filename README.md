# GreenSupply

GreenSupply helps small businesses in San Francisco buy sustainable packaging together instead of alone.  
By pooling orders with nearby businesses, members can unlock better bulk pricing, cut delivery trips, and reduce environmental impact.

## What It Does

GreenSupply is a two-sided platform for:

- **Businesses** that want affordable eco-friendly packaging
- **Suppliers** that want to fulfill coordinated neighborhood demand

The platform makes it easier to form local buying groups, track order progress, and move from individual purchases to shared procurement.

## How It Works

1. A business joins or proposes a group order for packaging.
2. Other nearby businesses commit units to the same group.
3. Once requirements are met, the order is confirmed.
4. Supplier fulfillment is coordinated, and order outcomes are tracked.

## Why It Matters

Small businesses often face a “green premium” when ordering sustainable packaging in low volumes.  
GreenSupply addresses that by combining demand, making sustainable choices more accessible and practical.

## Key Product Highlights

## AI in GreenSupply

GreenSupply uses Gemini to suggest high-potential group opportunities based on available supplier inventory and participation signals.  
These suggestions include recommended order settings and plain-language reasoning.

## Project Vision

Our goal is to make sustainable procurement feel as operationally simple as traditional purchasing while improving cost outcomes and reducing unnecessary delivery emissions.
